                <p><b>For the Rice Cake Dough:</b></p>
                <p>- 2 cups of sweet rice flour (also called glutinous rice flour)</p>
                <p>- 1/2 cup of water (approximately)</p>
                <p>- A pinch of salt</p>
                <p>- Food coloring (optional)</p>

                    <p><b>For the Filling:</b></p>
                    <p>- 1 cup of sweetened red bean paste</p>
                    <p>(or other desired fillings like sesame seeds or honey)</p>

                    <p><b>Preparing the Rice Cake Dough:</b>
                    <p>1. In a mixing bowl, combine the sweet rice flour and a pinch of salt.</p>
                    <p>2. Gradually add water and mix until the dough comes together and has a smooth, non-sticky consistency. You may need to adjust the water amount depending on the flour's moisture content.</p>
                    <p>3. If you want to make colored songpyeon, divide the dough into several portions and add a few drops of food coloring to each portion. Knead the dough until the color is evenly distributed.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="assembling">
                    <p><b>Assembling Songpyeon:</p></b>
                        <p>1. Take a small piece of the colored or plain dough and shape it into a small disk or ball in the palm of your hand.</p>
                        <p>2. Place a small amount (about 1 teaspoon) of the sweet red bean paste (or your desired filling) in the center of the dough.</p>
                        <p>3. Carefully fold the edges of the dough around the filling, sealing it completely. Make sure there are no holes where the filling can escape during cooking.</p>                        
                </div>
                <div class="cooking">
                    <p><b>Cooking Songpyeon:</p></b>
                    <p>1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt to the boiling water.</p>
                    <p>2. Gently place the songpyeon into the boiling water using a slotted spoon or strainer. Be careful not to overcrowd the pot.</p>
                    <p>3. Cook the songpyeon until they float to the surface, which usually takes 5-7 minutes. Cooking times may vary, so you can test one to ensure it's fully cooked.</p>
                    <p>4. Once they float, remove the cooked songpyeon with the slotted spoon and place them on a plate to cool.</p>

                    <p><b>Note: Serve your delicious songpyeon at room temperature. They are best enjoyed fresh and on the day they are made.</b></p>
